        "In this section, we briefly review some of the common notation used in graphs. Any graph consists of both a set of objects, called nodes, and the connections between these nodes, called edges. Mathematically, a graph $G$ is denoted as pair $G(V, E)$, where $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots v_n\\}$ represents the set of nodes and $E = \\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_m\\}$ represents the set of edges and the size of the set is commonly shown as $m = |E|$. Edges are also represented by their endpoints (nodes), so $e\\left(v_1, v_2\\right)$ or $\\left(v_1, v_2\\right)$ defines an edge between nodes $v_1$ and $v_2$. Edges can have directions if one node is connected to another, but not vice versa. When edges have directions, $e\\left(v_1, v_2\\right)$ is not the same as $e\\left(v_2, v_1\\right)$. When edges are undirected, nodes are connected both ways and are called undirected edges and this kind of graph is called an undirected graph. Graphs that only have directed edges are called directed graphs and ones that only have undirected edges are called undirected graphs. Finally, mixed graphs have both directed and undirected edges."

A closed path is called a cycle. The length of a path or cycle is the number of edges traversed in the path or cycle. In a directed graph, we only count directed paths because traversal of edges is only allowed in the direction of the edges. For a connected graph, multiple paths can exist between any pair of nodes. Often, we are interested in the path that has the shortest length. This path is called the shortest path. We will also use the shortest path as distance for modeling on networks. The concept of the neighborhood of a node $v_i$ can be generalized using shortest paths. An $n$-hop neighborhood of node $v_i$ is the set of nodes that are within $n$ hops distance from the node $v_i$."

Out-degree centrality describes the gregariousness of the node. For social media, degree represents the number of friends for each given user. On Facebook, a degree represents the number of friends. For Twitter, in-degree and out-degree show the number of followers and followees, respectively."

A value of 1 at row $i$, column $j$ in the adjacency matrix indicates a connection between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$, and a value of 0 denotes no connection between the two nodes. When generalized, any real number can be used to show the strength of connection between two nodes. In directed graphs, we can have two edges between $i$ and $j$ (one from $i$ to $j$ and one from $j$ to $i$), whereas in undirected graphs only one edge can exist. As a result, the adjacency matrix for directed graphs is not in general symmetric, whereas the adjacency matrix for undirected graphs is symmetric $\\left(A = A^T\\right)$. In social media, there are many directed and undirected networks. For instance, Facebook is an undirected network and Twitter is a directed network."
